# probits academy

Learn to code with us. We have created a new way of learning and put together an innovative curriculum beyond what you can learn in a traditional classroom. 

For now, we specialize in software design, infrastructure architecture and building microservices, and will expand into areas such as artificial intelligence and robotics in the future. 

Currently, we will start offering courses on:

#### javascript
* Angular - latest
* React
* node.js
* ES7 or latest

#### python
* flask
* django

#### version control
* git and mercurial


Our curriculum has been vetted by the community and will continue to be based on what latest and current best practices are for each individual topic. 

In other words, this is beyond your "Hello world" tutorials and basics. We are here to bridge your skills from beginner to master in all areas.
